A solid review of the current state of research in vision-based localization and mapping is presented in Cadena et al. \cite{cadena16}. The simplest solution consists of employing a single forward-facing monocular camera and employ either a sparse \cite{murartal15,engel14}, or semi-dense \cite{engel17}. feature detection and tracking solution. It is worth mentioning that vision-based solutions are often complemented by an inertial measurement unit. Both filter-based \cite{li13} and optimisation-based \cite{leutenegger15,lynen15,qin18} are commonly used.

%When employing a purely vision-based solution, using only a single camera may easily lead to drift accumulation and robustness issues. Past frameworks tested specifically in ground vehicle applications therefore often employ a stereo \cite{nister06,konolidge07,howard08,kitt10} or a surround-view multi-camera array \cite{furgale13,heng18}. The latter is particularly interesting as it is already commonly installed in modern cars.

%%%%%%%%% AGV with odometry sensors %%%%%%%%%%%%

%punchline hints: these works 1) either use alternative sensors to perform reintegration based on a kinematic model, and then add this as a regularisation constraint to the optimisation or embed into the state transition model (often assuming planar motion), 2) or they simply impose the non-holonomic constraint as a regularisation term between sub-sequent keyframes (again, mostly based on planar assumption). Note however that the is only an approximation and relies on the assumption that the steering angle is piece-wise constant, which is not the case! Then there is the mani fold work, but that one is also 

%The present work considers the improvement of a pure monocular SLAM solution by including vehicle kinematics related constraints into the optimisation framework. This technique is already commonly applied to vision-based multi-sensor solutions that make additional use of odometers measuring the rotational velocity of each wheel. There have been EKF filter \cite{wu17}, particle filter \cite{yap11}, and optimisation-based\cite{quan18,kang2019vins} solutions, which all rely on a driftless planar motion model as derived from a dual-drive or Ackermann steering platform. They perform relatively high-frequent integration of such information to come up with adequate priors on the relative displacement between subsequent views. Censi et al. \cite{censi13} furthermore consider simultaneous extrinsic calibration between cameras and odometers. A closely related vehicle motion model that has also been used in filtering and optimisation based frameworks appears for skid-steering platforms \cite{yi09,martinez17,lv17}. However, although slippage occurs, non-holonomic models relying on the Instantaneous Centre of Rotation still explain the motion of skid-steering platforms relatively well, which is why our work may also be applied to such platforms \cite{martinez05}. A very closely related work to ours is given Zhang et al. \cite{zhang19}, who still rely on a driftless non-holonomic motion model, but extend the estimation to non-planar environments by introducing the motion-manifold and manifold-based integration of odometry signals.

%%%%%%%%% Pure vision-based: Closed form solvers (ackermann) %%%%%%%%%%%

%For pure vision-based solutions, respecting the holonomic constraints is more difficult. Scaramuzza \cite{scaramuzza2009,scaramuzza2011} successfully introduced the Ackermann motion model into relative camera displacement estimation, thus leading to highly robust solutions based on 1-point ransac or 1D histogram voting. Huang et al. \cite{huang19} recently extended the method to an n-frame solver, while Lee et al. \cite{lee13} successfully applied the technique to a multi-camera array. Long et al. \cite{zong2017vehicle} and Li et al. \cite{li18} have included similar constraints into windowed optimisation frameworks, which essentially enforce the trajectory to be composed of piece-wise circular arcs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Continuous-time motion estimation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%A more correct imposition of non-holonomic constraints on the motion of a ground vehicle has been proposed in the robotics and control societies. The related works mostly aim at planning feasible trajectories for driftless ground vehicles, a challenging problem if both spatial and temporal constraints need to be taken into account. A in-depth introduction to the topic is given in \cite{soueres98}. Babu et al. \cite{babu17} recently introduce smooth collision-free trajectory planning for non-holonomic curvature-bounded vehicles based on alternating optimisation of linear velocities and angular accelerations. The problem simplifies if only considering geometric feasibility, in which case the vehicle trajectory can modelled using clothoids. For example, Lundberg \cite{lundberg17} introduces clothoid-based smoothing in A* path planning.

%From a purely geometric point of view, a driftless, non-holonomic ground vehicle moves along smooth trajectories in space, and---more importantly---its heading keeps pointing along the tangential of its trajectory. This motivates our use of continuous-time trajectories as proposed by Furgale et al. \cite{furgale2015continuous}. While parametrising a smooth vehicle trajectory, the representation is easily used to additionally constraint part of the vehicle orientation by considering first-order differentials.
